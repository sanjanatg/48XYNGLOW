# LLM, Find My Fund - Enhanced Features

This document summarizes the major enhancements added to the project.

## 1. RAG-powered Fund Explanations

We've implemented Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for detailed fund explanations. This feature:

- Retrieves fund metadata from the database
- Generates natural language explanations using LLM
- Provides risk assessments and investor suitability information
- Personalizes explanations based on user context

**API Endpoint:**
```python
@app.post("/explain", response_model=ExplainResponse, tags=["Explanations"])
async def explain_fund(
    explain_params: ExplainRequest,
    engine: SearchEngine = Depends(get_search_engine)
)
```

**Example Query:**
```
"Explain ICICI Prudential Technology Fund for retirement planning"
```

**Example Response:**
```
ICICI Prudential Technology Fund is a sectoral equity fund that primarily invests in technology companies. The fund focuses on businesses in software, IT services, hardware, and other tech-related sectors. As a sectoral fund, it carries higher risk due to its concentration in a single industry, making it susceptible to sector-specific downturns.

This fund is generally considered to have a high risk profile, as technology stocks can be volatile and sensitive to market cycles, regulatory changes, and technological disruptions. While the technology sector has historically delivered strong long-term growth, it also experiences significant short-term fluctuations.

For retirement planning, this fund should only represent a small portion of your portfolio (5-10% maximum) due to its higher risk nature. It would be more suitable as a satellite investment to complement core, more diversified funds in a long-term retirement strategy. Consider combining it with more stable large-cap or balanced funds for a well-rounded retirement portfolio.

Risk Level: High

## 2. Voice Interaction

We've integrated voice capabilities to make the app more accessible:

- Speech recognition for input queries
- Text-to-speech for responses
- Language-specific voice configuration

**Implementation:**
```typescript
// Initialize speech recognition
useEffect(() => {
  if (typeof window !== 'undefined' && ('SpeechRecognition' in window || 'webkitSpeechRecognition' in window)) {
    const SpeechRecognition = window.SpeechRecognition || window.webkitSpeechRecognition;
    recognitionRef.current = new SpeechRecognition();
    recognitionRef.current.continuous = false;
    recognitionRef.current.interimResults = false;
    
    // Set language for speech recognition based on selected language
    recognitionRef.current.lang = language === 'en' ? 'en-US' : 
                                language === 'hi' ? 'hi-IN' : 
                                language === 'ta' ? 'ta-IN' : ...
```

## 3. Multilingual Support

We've added support for 6 Indian languages:

- 🇬🇧 English (default)
- 🇮🇳 Hindi (हिंदी)
- 🇮🇳 Tamil (தமிழ்)
- 🇮🇳 Telugu (తెలుగు)
- 🇮🇳 Kannada (ಕನ್ನಡ)
- 🇮🇳 Marathi (मराठी)

**Language Selection UI:**
```tsx
const languages = [
  { code: 'en', name: 'English', flag: '🇬🇧' },
  { code: 'hi', name: 'हिंदी', flag: '🇮🇳' },
  { code: 'ta', name: 'தமிழ்', flag: '🇮🇳' },
  { code: 'te', name: 'తెలుగు', flag: '🇮🇳' },
  { code: 'kn', name: 'ಕನ್ನಡ', flag: '🇮🇳' },
  { code: 'mr', name: 'मराठी', flag: '🇮🇳' }
];
```

**API Translation Endpoint:**
```python
@app.post("/translate", response_model=TranslationResponse, tags=["Languages"])
async def translate(
    translation_params: TranslationRequest
)
```

## 4. Integrated Interface

We've created a unified experience by:

- Combining the fund search engine with a conversational UI
- Creating a modern, mobile-friendly interface
- Adding help features for user guidance
- Implementing a start script to launch all components

**Start All Components:**
```python
def main():
    """Main entry point that starts both servers."""
    print("Starting LLM, Find My Fund components...")
    
    # Start the API server in a separate thread
    api_thread = threading.Thread(target=start_fastapi_server)
    api_thread.daemon = True
    api_thread.start()
    
    # Wait a bit for the API to start
    time.sleep(2)
    
    # Start the Next.js server in the main thread
    start_nextjs_server()
```

## System Architecture

The enhanced system now follows this architecture:

```
User Input → Language Selection → Voice/Text Input →
→ Message Processing → Query Classification →
→ Fund Search OR Fund Explanation OR General Chat →
→ Response Translation → Language-specific Voice Output
```

This architecture provides a seamless, multimodal experience with advanced explainability for mutual fund search.

## Future Work

Potential enhancements for future development:

1. **Advanced RAG with Knowledge Graphs**: Enrich fund explanations with knowledge graphs of related companies, sectors, and market trends
2. **Real-time Data Integration**: Connect to live fund data APIs for NAV, returns, etc.
3. **Personalized Portfolio Analysis**: Analyze user's existing portfolio and suggest funds based on diversification needs
4. **More Regional Languages**: Add support for additional Indian languages
5. **Offline/Mobile Version**: Create a lightweight version for mobile devices with offline capabilities
