## Quick Summary

### Core Issues Fixed Across All Phases

1. **Phase 1 (Data Preprocessing)**:
   - Fixed path configuration issues for consistent data handling
   - Added comprehensive output file generation
   - Improved data type handling for numeric values

2. **Phase 2 (Embedding and Indexing)**:
   - Fixed missing mapping file generation
   - Added robust error handling for embedding processes
   - Improved configuration consistency

3. **Phase 3-4 (Search Engine & Query Parsing)**:
   - Fixed incomplete filter implementation
   - Improved path handling for consistent file access
   - Enhanced error propagation to the user interface

4. **Phase 5 (LLM Integration)**:
   - Added proper LLM response format validation
   - Improved context formatting for better results
   - Enhanced error handling for LLM interactions

5. **Phase 6 (RAG Prompt Engineering)**:
   - Implemented comprehensive error handling
   - Added robust data validation for fund information
   - Improved the user experience with better error messages

### Key Components Improved

1. **Search Engine**: More robust filtering, result ranking, and error handling
2. **RAG Implementation**: Reliable prompt generation with proper error handling
3. **Enhanced Retrieval**: Safer score computation and fund data handling
4. **Utils Module**: Consistent file paths and safer utility functions

## Overall Impact

These improvements significantly enhance the system's:
- **Reliability**: Less likely to fail with unexpected inputs or data
- **Robustness**: Better handling of edge cases and error conditions
- **Usability**: Improved error messages and user feedback
- **Maintainability**: Cleaner code with better logging and documentation

All changes were made with careful attention to preserving the original functionality while adding safeguards against potential failures.
