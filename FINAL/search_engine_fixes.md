# Search Engine: Bug Fixes and Improvements

## Overview
This document details the bug fixes and improvements made to the `MutualFundSearchEngine` class, which is the primary interface for searching mutual funds based on user queries.

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. Path Configuration Issues
- **Issue**: Hard-coded file paths in the `__init__` method that could fail on different environments.
- **Fix**: Updated to use the `utils.get_output_paths()` function for consistent path handling:
```python
# Get paths from utils if not provided
output_paths = utils.get_output_paths()
if embeddings_path is None:
    embeddings_path = output_paths["fund_embeddings"]
if index_path is None:
    index_path = output_paths["faiss_index"]
# ... and so on
```

### 2. Incomplete filter_results Method
- **Issue**: The `filter_results` method was incomplete and didn't handle all filter types properly.
- **Fix**: Completely rewrote the method to properly handle all filter types with appropriate error handling:
```python
def filter_results(self, results, filters):
    """
    Apply filters to search results.
    """
    if not filters:
        return results
    
    filtered_results = []
    
    for result in results:
        fund_data = result.get('fund_data', {})
        include = True
        
        # Apply each filter
        for filter_key, filter_value in filters.items():
            # Handle different types of filters
            if filter_key == 'amc' and 'amc' in fund_data:
                if fund_data['amc'].lower() != filter_value.lower():
                    include = False
                    break
            # ... additional filter handling
    
    return filtered_results
```

### 3. Error Handling in search Method
- **Issue**: Insufficient error handling in the `search` method could lead to silent failures.
- **Fix**: Added comprehensive error handling with informative messages:
```python
try:
    # Extract structured filters from the query using QueryParser
    extracted_filters = {}
    if apply_filters:
        extracted_filters = self.query_parser.parse_query(query)
        logger.info(f"Extracted filters from query: {extracted_filters}")
        
    # ... search logic ...
except Exception as e:
    logger.error(f"Error during search: {str(e)}")
    raise
```

### 4. Fund Description Generation
- **Issue**: The `generate_fund_description` method could fail with missing or invalid data.
- **Fix**: Added safe access patterns with proper defaults for all fund data fields:
```python
# Add information about top holdings if available
if fund_data.get('top_holdings') and len(fund_data.get('top_holdings')) > 0:
    top_holdings = fund_data.get('top_holdings')[:3]  # Get top 3 holdings
    description += f"Top holdings include {', '.join(top_holdings)}. "
```

## Code Improvements

### Enhanced Error Handling
Added try/except blocks around all critical operations with proper logging:
```python
try:
    logger.info(f"Loading embedding model: {model_name}")
    self.model = SentenceTransformer(model_name)
except Exception as e:
    logger.error(f"Failed to load embedding model: {str(e)}")
    raise
```

### Safe Data Access
Implemented consistent patterns for accessing potentially missing data:
```python
fund_id = self.index_to_fund_id.get(str(idx))
if fund_id and fund_id in self.funds_data:
    fund_data = self.funds_data[fund_id]
    # ... process fund data ...
```

### Improved Result Handling
Enhanced the result processing with better data validation:
```python
results.append({
    'fund_id': fund_id,
    'similarity': float(similarity),
    'rank': i + 1,
    'fund_data': fund_data,
    'description': description,
    'fund_name': fund_data.get('fund_name', 'Unknown'),
    'category': fund_data.get('category', 'Unknown'),
    'amc': fund_data.get('amc', 'Unknown'),
    'risk_level': fund_data.get('risk_level', 'Unknown'),
    'score': float(similarity)
})
```

## Impact

These improvements make the Search Engine component:
1. More robust against configuration and path issues
2. Better at handling filters from user queries
3. More reliable in generating fund descriptions
4. Providing better error feedback and logging
5. Less likely to fail with unexpected or missing data

The changes significantly improve the user experience by ensuring that searches complete successfully and return meaningful results, even when dealing with complex queries or incomplete fund data.
