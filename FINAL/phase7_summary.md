# Phase 7: Evaluation & Test Query Defense

## Overview
In Phase 7, we've implemented a comprehensive evaluation framework for the mutual fund search system. The goal is to assess the accuracy and robustness of the system across various types of user queries and use cases, measuring how well it handles real-world search scenarios.

## Implementation Details

### Evaluation Framework
We've created a `SystemEvaluator` class that can test all components of the mutual fund search system:

```python
class SystemEvaluator:
    """
    Comprehensive evaluator for the mutual fund recommendation system.
    Tests various aspects of the system including search accuracy, query parsing,
    and result relevance.
    """
    
    def __init__(self, search_engine=None, query_parser=None, retrieval=None, llm=None):
        # Initialize components or use provided ones
        ...
        
    def run_complete_evaluation(self):
        """Run a complete evaluation of all components"""
        evaluation_results = {
            "fuzzy_name_tests": self.evaluate_fuzzy_name_searches(),
            "slang_tests": self.evaluate_slang_searches(),
            "filter_tests": self.evaluate_filter_logic(),
            "end_to_end_tests": self.evaluate_end_to_end()
        }
        ...
```

The evaluator integrates with all previous phases:
1. Data Preprocessing (Phase 1) - Utilizing the processed fund data
2. Embedding & Indexing (Phase 2) - Testing the search functionality
3. Query Understanding (Phase 3) - Evaluating filter extraction
4. Search Engine (Phase 4) - Testing result relevance
5. Enhanced Retrieval (Phase 5) - Evaluating ranking quality
6. Prompt Engineering (Phase 6) - Testing RAG effectiveness

### Test Cases
We've implemented three main categories of test cases:

1. **Fuzzy Fund Name Tests**:
   - Tests for abbreviated fund names ("hdfc top 100" → "HDFC Top 100 Fund")
   - Tests for misspelled fund names (variations in spelling)
   - Tests for partial fund names (incomplete mentions)

2. **Slang & Common Terms Tests**:
   - Tests for industry slang like "tax saver" (mapping to ELSS funds)
   - Tests for common financial terms like "emergency funds" (mapping to liquid funds)
   - Tests for goal-based terms like "retirement" (mapping to appropriate fund types)

3. **Filter Logic Tests**:
   - Tests for complex queries with multiple constraints ("high return AND low risk")
   - Tests for numeric filters (expense ratio, returns, etc.)
   - Tests for categorical filters (AMC, category, sector)

### Accuracy Measurement

For each test case, we define ground truth expectations and measure if the system:
- Returns the correct fund in the top results
- Extracts the correct filters from the query
- Ranks the most relevant results at the top

The accuracy is calculated as:
```python
accuracy = (correct_results / total_tests) * 100
```

We measure accuracy separately for each category and also calculate an overall system accuracy.

### Evaluation Report & Visualization

The evaluator generates detailed reports in multiple formats:
- JSON report with detailed per-test results
- Summary table with accuracy metrics
- Visualization of accuracy across test categories

```python
def generate_evaluation_report(self, eval_results=None):
    # Generate report and visualizations
    ...
    summary_table = [
        ["Metric", "Accuracy"],
        ["Overall Accuracy", f"{report['summary']['overall_accuracy']:.1f}%"],
        ["Fuzzy Fund Name Search", f"{report['summary']['fuzzy_name_accuracy']:.1f}%"],
        ["Slang & Common Terms", f"{report['summary']['slang_accuracy']:.1f}%"],
        ["Filter Logic", f"{report['summary']['filter_logic_accuracy']:.1f}%"]
    ]
    ...
```

### End-to-End Testing

In addition to component-specific tests, we conduct end-to-end testing that exercises the full system pipeline:
1. Query parsing
2. Search with filters
3. Enhanced retrieval scoring
4. RAG prompt generation
5. LLM response generation

This simulates the complete user experience and tests the integration of all components.

## Relation to Previous Phases

Phase 7 builds directly on and evaluates all previous phases:

- **Phase 1 (Data Preprocessing)**: Utilizes the processed fund data as ground truth for evaluation
- **Phase 2 (Embedding & Indexing)**: Tests the vector search accuracy for finding relevant funds
- **Phase 3 (Query Understanding)**: Evaluates the parser's ability to extract filters from natural language
- **Phase 4 (Search Engine)**: Tests the search engine's ability to match queries to relevant funds
- **Phase 5 (Enhanced Retrieval)**: Evaluates the scoring mechanisms that combine different signals
- **Phase 6 (Prompt Engineering)**: Tests the system's ability to generate effective RAG prompts

## Explainability Toggle

As a bonus feature, we've added explanations for search results and scoring, which can be toggled:

```python
# Example of how scoring explanations are provided
result['score_explanation'] = {
    'semantic_similarity': f"{semantic_score:.4f} × {self.weights['semantic']:.1f}",
    'metadata_match': f"{metadata_score:.4f} × {self.weights['metadata']:.1f}",
    'fuzzy_match': f"{fuzzy_score:.4f} × {self.weights['fuzzy']:.1f}",
    'final_score': f"{final_score:.4f}"
}
```

These explanations can be displayed in the UI by adding a toggle to show/hide them, helping users understand why certain funds are recommended.

## Benefits of this Approach

1. **Comprehensive Testing**: Tests all aspects of the system with diverse query types
2. **Quantitative Metrics**: Provides clear accuracy metrics for system performance
3. **Diagnostic Capability**: Identifies specific areas for improvement
4. **Reproducible Tests**: Standardized tests enable consistent evaluation
5. **Explainability**: Added transparency into why results are ranked as they are

## Usage

To run the evaluation:
```
python FINAL/evaluation.py
```

This will:
1. Run all test cases
2. Generate a detailed report in `processed_data/evaluation_report.json`
3. Create a visualization in `processed_data/evaluation_results.png`
4. Display a summary table with accuracy metrics

## Future Improvements

1. **Expand Test Cases**: Add more diverse and challenging test cases
2. **User Feedback Integration**: Incorporate user feedback into evaluation metrics
3. **Automated Regression Testing**: Set up automated testing to ensure new changes don't reduce accuracy
4. **A/B Testing Framework**: Compare different configurations of weights and settings
5. **Human Evaluation**: Complement automated tests with human evaluator feedback
